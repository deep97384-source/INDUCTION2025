# FOOD: A PIVOTAL ROLE IN STUDENTS'S WELLNESS

## With the starting of day 2 at college, With our arrival to college, two proficiency tests:

## English Proficiency Test
## Mathematics Proficiency Test were conducted by our seniors so as to understand us and our intelligence. My both test went good but not better , may be because all basic concepts that i forgot in past 3,4 months . After both the tests were conducted, we were taken to the auditorium for the event. After about 30 minutes, all students were addressed by agents of NEHRU SIDHANT KENDER TRUST about their SATYA SCHOLARSHIP aimed to provide service to atleast 50 needy students from the college.It was good what a great work they are doing to empower the future of india. Following them, DR.ARASHDEEP SINGH came and addressed us about why health is also important with studies. He educated us which type of food to eat and to avoid junk food for main meals of the day. He also adrressed to some most common rumours and myths related to food. His lecture was very much informative and useful for me. After his education, our seniors introduced us to GITHUB and MARKDOWN platforms for our activities and assignments submission

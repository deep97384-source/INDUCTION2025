# INDUCTION2025
# Day 1 (31st july,2025)
## My first day at college started by visiting gurudwara sahib located in the college campus. The shape of Gurudwara sahib was resembling to ship which teaches us that we all are in a jahaz or ship of waheguru/god. The atmosphere was positive and calm. After having kadah prasad,i went to the auditorium where we got our welcome kits. The stage was beatifully decorated for our welcome.After a period of time, we were introduced to the 2 successfull alumini through their motivational video message. The college has also completed their 70 glorious years. After this, we were addressed by respectful dignitaries of college: DR.SEHAJPAL SINGH (PRINCIPAL), DR.HARPREET KAUR GREWAL (HOD, APPLIEAD SCIENCES), DR.AKSHAY GIRDHAR(DEAN ACADEMICS) were among them.their words felt like we were already a part of GNDEC family. Then the chief guest came ER.RAVINDER GARG who is the chief engineer at municipal corportation ludhiana. He taught us how with time everything is evolved and we need to work hard to achieve success.Following him is IInd chief guest ER.RAKESH KUMAR (ADC LUDHIANA) who was a a GNDEC alumunus of 1991 batch.His moral and ethical values left a deep impact in my mind. We were also taught about education loan, the terms and conditions required, the benefits one can avail etc. After the event in auditorium was over, we were taken to our alloted buildings where college faculty introduced themselves.DR.KIRAN JYOTI (HOD of CS) came and talked with us about how our hardwork, deication and skills will make us get good packages. We were informed about examinations, clubs, mentoring groups and other important information. We also visited the labs situated within our block.It felt very warmed and comfortable after interacting with college faculty.In this way the first day of college ended happily:)##
